We need to find the probability that all the containers are of the same type (either all bowls or all plates) are adjacent.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's figure out how many ways we can arrange these 7 containers. Since they are all different, the total number of arrangements is 7! (7 factorial). That's 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. So, 7! = 5040.\n",
